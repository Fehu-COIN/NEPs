## Summary

This proposal introduces shard-locally shared contract code, which enables accounts to refer to contract hashes of deployed contracts that live in a special storage called Shared Ephemeral Storage (SES). SES has no storage staking cost.

Data in SES is shared among every account on the same shard. It has a limited lifetime before it is deleted, but everytime it is accessed, its lifetime is extended. Contracts can modify the state of the account; this state is not shared. Only code is shared, not the data.

The key for data in SES is the hash of the value. This makes it immutable and allows users to trust that the shared code is never modified.

## Motivation

- Certain basic functionality contracts such as dead man switch or multi-signature contracts require ~1 NEAR just to cover the storage staking. If a user is using zero-balance accounts and meta-transactions to cover costs, it is highly likely that they wouldn't have any NEAR on their accounts.

- There are certain proxy contracts that are repeatedly deployed to different accounts for certain apps to function. One example is KeyPom, which deploys a contract costing 0.4 NEAR as a proxy contract for all of the trial accounts. This is not sustainable for businesses or individual users.

As this is a part of the [Account Extensions upgrade](https://github.com/near/NEPs/issues/478), some of the benefits of account namespaces are realized in conjunction with other proposals from the upgrade:

- Contract namespaces (submodules) can reference SES code, enabling easy and cheap contract composability.

## Specification

### The `SES` Trie Key

We introduce a new trie key: `SES`. It maps code hashes to epoch IDs. This defines when the code "expires" and is updated to "current_epoch +2" every time the code is accessed.

### The `SES` RocksDB Column

The contract code itself lives in a separate RocksDB column, which must also be synced during state sync.

### `DeployContract` action

The `DeployContract` action is modified to include a flag named `is_ses` that would deploy the contract to SES. The effect of this flag is that the contract code is not stored in the account's storage, but in the `SES` column instead, and the SES code is referred to by the receiving account as its deployed contract code.

The cost to deploy to SES is the same as deploying a contract normally.

### RPC view calls

#### `view_account`

The `view_account` call now also returns a field called `shard_id` that reveals which shard the account lives on.

#### `view_code`

The `view_code` call returns the SES code just as it would return the code of a normally-deployed contract. A new field, `is_ses`, is also introduced, containing a boolean value indicating whether the code is stored in SES.

## Reference Implementation

- WIP

## Security Implications

- When SES code expires, it is deleted, rendering every referent soft-locked. The soft lock is resolved when any account referencing the code re-deploys it. The re-deploy must be of identical code to the same shard ID.

## Drawbacks

- Exposes sharding to developers.
- Code expires.
- More complicated `DeployContract` action.

## Unresolved Issues (Optional)

- How long should the code live in SES before it expires?
- How would SES integrate with dynamic sharding?
- What happens when you `FUNCTION_CALL` a SES contract that references expired code?

## Alternatives

- Hereditary "pinned" sub-accounts: when a sub-account is created, we add a flag (e.g. `pin`), which locks the sub-account to the same shard as the parent. The child can then reference code deployed by the parent by hash, similarly to the SES model described by this NEP. This version does not explicitly expose sharding, but it does severely limit which accounts are eligible to use the shared code storage.

## Future possibilities

See [the Account Extensions upgrade master issue](https://github.com/near/NEPs/issues/478).

## Changelog

### 1.0.0 - Initial Version

#### Benefits

- Cheaper contract deployments. With zero-balance accounts, preexisting contracts could even be deployed (and composed, to some extent) for free.
- Well-known/official/audited/standard/etc. contracts can be deployed to all shards and used without fear of, for example, a developer compiling them incorrectly, or them being tampered with in some other way.
